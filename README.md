SnapGroups is a module for the Android Xposed Framework that lets
users create Friend Groups. This lets users send SnapChats to lists
of people without having to scroll through their hundreds of friends.

Requirements:
Snapchat 9.0.1.0
Rooted Android Device
Xposed Framework Installed


How To Use:
Take a picture with SnapChat (of anything) and hit the >> (Arrow button).
On the next screen, you will see a new button in the app header.
Use that to make predefined lists of your friends.
To send the snap to a list, hit the SnapGroup icon, check the list you want to send to, and hit "Send to Checked Groups!".
That last button won't actually send it, but it will check those names in the SnapChat Send To page for you.
